The Github repo is available at https://github.com/JulieMaricicDetweiler/DebugDynasty.git. The repo is currently private for confidentiality issues but can be cloned to one's local machine. The command to do this in terminal is 'git clone https://github.com/JulieMaricicDetweiler/DebugDynasty.git'
In order to ensure that the most up-to-date version is being accesssed, the command 'npm run build' must be executed.
If this command creates issues, this is likely due to missing dependencies, such as:
npm not found - can be resovled with installing npm from the web: https://docs.npmjs.com/downloading-and-installing-node-js-and-npm
Can't resolve 'mui/...' - can be resolved with 'npm install @mui/material @emotion/react @emotion/styled'

Once the program is successfully built, the web app can be accessed with 'npm start'
Files must be saved in development environment before changes are reflected in the local execution. If this is not working, try Ctrl + C or Cmd + C to terminate the current batch job and restart the deployment.
